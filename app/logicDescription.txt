This is a description of the intended skip logic and the format for storing
said logic.


The main focus of the logic is to hide form elements that are irrellevant
based on previous answers, or more precisely, to only show relevant fields.

To achieve this, we apply a format which is able to give a field a list of
requirements, hiding this field until the requirements are fulfilled.

The base format is a JSON array on this form:

[
   "connectedFormId" : "<formId>",
   "fields" : [ 
      "fieldId" : "<fieldId>",
      "fieldRequirements" : [
         <requirement1>,
         <requirement2>,
         ... ]
   ]
]


When the form is read, the logic is to be merged << is this possible? -LarsÃ˜
>> into the form data structure, so the logic can be applied.
